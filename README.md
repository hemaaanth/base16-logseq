# Base16 LoqSeq

Base16 Styles for [LogSeq](https://logseq.com).

See the [Base16 repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for more information.

## Installation

Select one of the many colour schemes available for [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16), look for the corresponding CSS file in the `css` folder and update your `logseq/custom.css` with the contents of the file.

OR

Use a tool like [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus-beta/apmmpaebfobifelkijhaljbmpcgbjbdo/related?hl=en).

## Supported Features

* Basic colour scheme
* CodeMirror

## To-do List

* Graph colours
* Left panel for small screens
* A lot more that has been missed

## Issues

At the moment I won't respond to issues, as LogSeq are still in the process of re-working their CSS to be variable based, so these themes have the potential to break at any release. As of 0.0.4, the prebuilt css files in the `css` folder work.
